- 👋 Hi, I’m @voidespy | Arch Magus | Goetia Nil
- 👀 I’m a Technical Game Designer but I'm interesting into some of the more rigorous programming within' Game Development.
- 🌱 I've been using C# for a while (and getting better); and I'm currently trying out some Full-Stack Development skills, getting better at data structures and algorithms in general though. Python and C++ are also becoming more utilized on my end, but I'm slowly getting into Rust too. I haven't touched JavaScript in a while.
- 💞️ Gaming is my passion, and writing is something that relaxes me. I'm getting into AI too; I enjoy data.
- I would like to add, there are not many contributions in 2022 because my mother was murdered during that year and I started placing some of bigger projects in a Perforce server locally.
