- 👋 Hi, I’m @voidespy | Arch Magus | Goetia Nil | ThyArcanist
- 👀 I’m a Technical Game Designer but I'm interesting into some of the more rigorous, deep programming within' Game Development.
- 🌱 Constantly learning more and experiments with different technologies, I'm finding that I really like C# and Rust. But I'm defintely going to need to delve back into C++.
- 💞️ Gaming is my passion; writing and coding is something that relaxes me. I've unforunately, simulated code in my dreams and brainstormed solutions in my sleep as well, not quite sure how I feel about that still. My current hyperfixation is Greek Mythology. Brainstorming a project relating to that to make in the next several months.
