- 👋 Hi, I’m @voidespy
- 👀 I’m a Game Designer but I'm interesting into some of the more rigorous programming within' Game Development. Outside of coding and game dev, I'm learning Korean.
- 🌱 I have learned C# (and getting better); and I'm currently learning C++, getting better at data structures and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating vidya' games.
- 📫 Reach me on twitter!

I've gotten interviews at a few game dev studios. However, I've gotten no offer. Big name places, hopefully I have some new interviews in the next few weeks.
I'm still applying; and no other interviews thus far. I'm working at a super cool company as a Simulation Designer! :D
- Each time I go into the gauntlet, I know a little more of what I need to refine.
