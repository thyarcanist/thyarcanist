- 👋 Hi, I’m @thyarcanist | Arch Magus | Goetia Nil | Voidespy
- 👀 I’m a Technical Game Designer but I'm pivoting to AI / ML with Machine Learning likely with a deeper interest into Deep RL, GenAI and LLM.
- 🌱 Constantly learning more and experiments with different technologies, I'm finding that I really like C# and Rust. But I'm defintely going to need to delve back into C++. Okay... I'm really digging LLM, NLPs and such so, I'm getting back into Python and learning more about Generative AI especially; suprised I haven't encountered Jupyter Notebook sooner.
- 💞️ Gaming is my passion; writing and coding is something that relaxes me. I've unforunately, simulated code in my dreams and brainstormed solutions in my sleep as well, not quite sure how I feel about that still. My current hyperfixation is Greek Mythology. Brainstorming a project relating to that to make in the next several months.
- I will note that the biggest things of not contributing to Github this year is because I was working on a project where I had to use Unity's PlasticSCM for source control; I made so many commits and I'm basically using that for Unity projects now.
