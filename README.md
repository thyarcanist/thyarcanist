- 👋 Hi, I’m @voidespy
- 👀 I’m a Game Designer but I'm interesting into some of the more rigorous programming within' Game Development. Outside of coding and game dev, I'm learning Korean.
- 🌱 I have learned C# (and getting better); and I'm currently trying out some Full-Stack Development skills, getting better at data structures and algorithms in general though.
- 💞️ Gaming is my passion, and writing is something that relaxes me.
