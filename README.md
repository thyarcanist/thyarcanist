- 👋 Hi, I’m @voidespy | Arch Magus | Goetia Nil
- 👀 I’m a Technical Game Designer but I'm interesting into some of the more rigorous programming within' Game Development.
- 🌱 Constantly learning more and experiments with different technologies, I'm finding that I really like C# and Rust.
- 💞️ Gaming is my passion; writing and coding is something that relaxes me. I've unforunately, simulated code in my dreams and brainstormed solutions, not quite sure how I feel about that still.
