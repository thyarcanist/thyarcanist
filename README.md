- 👋 Hi, I’m @voidespy
- 👀 I’m a Game Designer but I'm interesting into some of the more rigious programming within' Game Development. Outside of coding and game dev, I'm learning Korean.
- 🌱 I have learned C# (and getting better); and I'm currently learning C++, getting better at data structures and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating vidya' games.
- 📫 Reach me on twitter!

I've gotten Interviews at Rockstar, Beenox, Harebrained Schemes and Hypixel. :)
I made it to Stage 4 at Beenox but alas, no offer. All were me applying to Technical Game Designer positions. 
I'm still applying and interviewing currently.
- Each time I go into the gauntlet, I know a little more of what I need to refine.
